    instructions: '1 Pre-soak the beans, either by covering with two inches of water and soaking overnight, or by pouring boiling water over them and soaking them for an hour. 2 Drain the beans and put them in a medium-sized pot and cover with 2 inches of water.  Bring to a simmer, cover, reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook until the beans are just soft enough to eat, about 1 hour, give or take 15 minutes or so, depending on how old the beans are (older beans will take longer to cook).3 Preheat the oven to 325°F.  In a 3 or 4 quart heavy-bottomed, oven-proof, lidded pot such as a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until lightly browned and crispy.4 Add the chopped onions and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring often, until the onions begin to brown. Use a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits off the bottom of the pot. 5 Add the garlic, chile flakes and sage and cook for 1-2 minutes, then add the honey and tomato paste. Stir well to combine. Add the tomatoes or tomato sauce and the stock.  Bring to a simmer. Taste for salt and add some if needed. 6 Drain the beans and add them to the pot. Stir well. Cover the pot and cook in the oven for an hour and fifteen minutes. If still a bit wet, remove the cover and cook for 15 minutes more.  Note that the cooking time will depend on several things, the most important being how thoroughly the beans were cooked to begin with when they were simmered.  If they are still a bit hard when they go in the oven, it may take several hours to soften them, once the tomato and honey have been added.7 Right before serving, gently stir in the chopped parsley and balsamic vinegar.

Beat in the salt and vanilla. Reduce speed to low and add sour cream and eggs. Scrape sides of bowl well. Stir in the baking soda, then add the flour and stir (be careful not to overbeat) until it’s mixed in (As always, I add the flour by hand and use a heavy duty scraper to mix it).Spread about half the batter over bottom of pan. Sprinkle crumb mixture even over batter. Carefully spread remaining batter over crumbs. This is tricky, but doable – just drop blobs of batter over the crumbs and use a rubber scraper to gently spread the batter across the crumbs.Toss the blueberries in the flour and sprinkle evenly over the top. If you want to skip the flour-tossing, I think you’d be okay. I noticed flour stuck to the blueberries and was visible after baking and didn’t like that.Bake for about 45 minutes or until edges are very lightly browned. Let cool completely on a wire rack.

When oil is shimmering, add onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and translucent, about 7 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, wine, and vinegar and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring periodically. Set aside.                                                                                    2                                              For the Stacks: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.

Meanwhile, working in batches, dunk zucchini slices in egg wash, shaking off excess, then dredge in breadcrumb mixture. Fry zucchini, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 6 minutes total. Drain on a paper-towel-lined plate.

Top pepperoni with a dollop of tomato sauce, then sprinkle a small amount of both cheeses and basil on top. Repeat with another layer of fried zucchini, followed by pepperoni, tomato sauce, cheeses, and basil. Finish each stack with the remaining 4 fried zucchini rounds and top with spoonfuls of tomato sauce.

Slowly add in the 3/4 C. sugar and beat until the whites are thick and glossy.Add the gelatin mixture to the curd in the large bowl and mix well. Fold the whipped egg whites into the curd mixture in two additions.Beat the whipping cream until stiff peaks form. Reserve 1 C. For topping. Fold the remaining whipped cream into the curd mixture in two additions.Spray the sides of your springform pan lightly with non-stick spray. Spoon the mousse into the pan and level the top.Chill for several hours or until the mousse is firm. Spread the remaining lime curd on top of the chilled mousse and level and smooth.To unmold and decorate: Take a hot, wet washcloth and run it along the sides of the springform pan to loosen the mousse. Unlatch the springform pan and lift the sides straight off of the mousse. Place the remaining whipping cream in a piping bag fitted with a star tip and pipe swirls all along the top perimeter of the pie. Add the lime slices into the whipped cream to garnish.Serve chilled.',

Add the sugar and salt and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse just until the dough begins to come together and looks crumbly.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Whisk the egg yolk and half-and-half together in a small bowl. Add the vanilla and whisk to combine. Add to the flour mixture and pulse until the mixture forms a dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, gather it into a ball, and press into a disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let warm for a few minutes to relax the dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a circle just under 14 inch thick.  Gently fold the circle over the rolling pin and lift into a 9-inch pie pan. Press the dough into the pan and trim the edges to a 12-inch overhang. Roll the edge of the dough under itself and tuck and pinch to create a fluted edge; you can also use a fork to create a decorative finish. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Preheat the oven to 350°F. Prick the bottom of the dough all over with a fork. Line with a square of parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 12 minutes.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Lift out the liner and weights and bake for another 12 to 15 minutes, or until the shell is lightly browned and cooked through on the bottom. Let cool, then wrap well in plastic wrap and freeze. Fill the shell with the ice cream, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for at least 4 hours.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            For the Meringue: Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Combine the sugar, water, corn syrup, and salt in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring once or twice to dissolve the sugar; once the sugar is dissolved, do not stir the syrup again. Insert a candy thermometer in the pan. When the syrup reaches 215°F, turn the mixer on to medium speed and start whipping the egg whites. (You want to time the whipping of the egg whites so that they reach soft peaks by the time the syrup is ready.) When the egg whites begin to foam, add the cream of tartar.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            When the syrup reaches 238°F, remove it from the heat. With the mixer on medium speed, carefully pour the syrup out in a slow, steady stream down the side of the mixer bowl—be careful not to let the stream of syrup come into contact with the whisk. Once all of the syrup has been added, add the vanilla seeds, if using, turn the speed upto high, and whip until the meringue forms billowy peaks and is cool.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Remove the ice cream pie from the freezer and mound dollops of the meringue on top. Place in the freezer, uncovered, until ready to serve. (The assembled pie can be stored in your freezer for up to a month. Once the meringue has frozen, wrap the entire pie in plastic wrap.)                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Preheat the oven to 475°F. Remove the pie from the freezer and bake for about 5 minutes, just enough to brown the meringue on top and slightly melt the edges of the ice cream. Slice and serve.',

    instructions: 'Watch how to make this recipe.                    For the steak: Begin with setting up an assembly line of dishes. Mix the milk with the eggs in one; the flour mixed with the seasoned salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper, paprika and cayenne in another; and the meat in a third. Then have one clean plate at the end to receive the breaded meat.                          Work with one piece of meat at a time. Sprinkle both sides with kosher salt and black pepper, then place it in the flour mixture. Turn to coat. Place the meat into the milk/egg mixture, turning to coat. Finally, place it back in the flour and turn to coat (dry mixture/wet mixture/dry mixture). Place the breaded meat on the clean plate, then repeat with the remaining meat.                          Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter. Drop in a few sprinkles of flour to make sure it\'s sufficiently hot. When the butter sizzles immediately, you know it\'s ready. (It should not brown right away, if it does, the fire is too hot.) Cook the meat, 3 pieces at a time, until the edges start to look golden brown, about 2 minutes each side. Remove the meat to a paper towel-lined plate and keep them warm by covering lightly with another plate or a sheet of foil. Repeat until all the meat is cooked.                          After all the meat is fried, pour off the grease into a heatproof bowl. Without cleaning the skillet, return it to the stove over medium-low heat. Add 1/4 cup of the grease back to the skillet and allow it to heat up.                          For the gravy: When the grease is hot, sprinkle the flour evenly over the grease. Using a whisk, mix the flour with the grease, creating a golden-brown paste. Add more flour if it looks overly greasy; add a little more grease if it becomes too pasty/clumpy. Keep cooking until the roux reaches a deep golden brown color.                          Pour in the milk, whisking constantly. Add the seasoned salt and black pepper to taste and cook, whisking, until the gravy is smooth and thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Be prepared to add more milk if it becomes overly thick.

    title: 'Steamed Lobster with Herb Sauce and Lobster Bisque',
    hashtags: ['lunch', 'main course', 'main dish', 'dinner'],
    instructions: 'Steam the lobsters1. Place the lobsters in a nonreactive pan, like stainless steel, and add 4 cups of water. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. It is important to realize that it may take a while, maybe as long as 10 to 15 minutes, for the liquid to come to a boil. If the lobsters are turning red at this point, move them around a little in the pan to get the ones on top into the hot liquid underneath. Boil gently for 1 or 2 minutes, and then remove them from the heat and let cool in the liquid, covered, for about 30 minutes, or until they are cool enough to handle. Reserve 2 cups of the cooking liquid for the herb sauce and the remaining liquid for the bisque.2. To shell the lobsters, first remove the two claws and the tail from each. A great deal of liquid (about 1 1/2 cups) will come out; reserve this for the bisque. Press on the shell of the tail to crack it, and remove the meat from the shell. The meat should be barely cooked. Split the tail in half lengthwise and remove the vein or intestinal tract.3. Cover the claws with a kitchen towel and break them with a heavy objecta can, meat pounder, or skillet. (Placing a towel on top keeps the juices from splattering all over.) When the claws are cracked, try to remove the meat in one piece. Remove and discard the piece of cartilage that is inside each claw. The knobby articulation or joint that connects the claw to the body contains the finest meat in the lobster. Crack or cut this area with scissors and remove the meat.4. In a gratin dish lined with plastic wrap, arrange the meat in per-portion groupings, with half a tail, 1 claw, and some of the pieces from the articulation placed tightly together in one layer in the dish. Cover tightly with the wrap and refrigerate, if preparing the day before.5. When ready to reheat the lobster, melt the butter and pour it over the lobster meat in the gratin dish. Cover again tightly with plastic wrap, so the lobster pieces are soaked in butter. Warm in a very low (130F to 160F / 54C to 71C) oven. The lobster should reheat slowly so it can be served warm and remain very tender. If reheated in hot liquid or in too hot an oven, the meat tends to seize and toughen, so it is important to reheat it slowly and in butter, which will be used to make the herb butter sauce at serving time.Make the lobster bisque6. Discard all the shells except the lobster bodies, where all the appendages are attached. Cut the bodies into four or five pieces each, and place them in one layer in a large saucepan with the olive oil. Cook for 7 or 8 minutes, until the moisture has evaporated and the bodies start to brown. There will be a wonderful aroma from the browning.7. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes for the pieces to brown properly, and then add the chopped onion, leek, celery, and garlic cloves. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. To that, add the white wine, tomato juice or Bloody Mary mix (which gives some zip to the sauce), the reserved juice (about 1 1/2 cups) from shelling the cooked lobsters, and what is left of the cooking broth from the lobsters (beyond the 2 cups already reserved for the herb sauce). Add the herbes de Provence, tarragon, salt, and cayenne pepper. Bring to a boil and cook gently, partially covered, for 30 to 40 minutes.8. Strain in a colander, pressing on the solids with a spoon to extract all the liquid. Discard the lobster shells, and strain the mixture again through a double-mesh strainer, so it is very smooth. Cover and refrigerate if not serving immediately. When ready to serve, add the heavy cream and Cognac, bring to a boil, and taste for salt and pepper.Make the herb sauce9. Reduce the reserved lobster broth to 1 cup, to intensify the taste. Thicken it with the 1 teaspoon of potato starch dissolved in the 1 tablespoon of water. This can be done ahead.10. When ready to serve, add the chopped parsley, chives, and tarragon to the sauce. Pour the butter used for reheating the lobster into the sauce, and return the lobster to the warm oven. Bring the sauce to a boil; the butter will be emulsified with the liquid and create a smooth, creamy, and delicate sauce. Add some salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. If available, add the Asian garlic-chile paste. It gives a special accent to the sauce.Prepare the fingerling potatoes11. Peel the potatoes and cook them in salted water for 20 to 25 minutes, depending on size. Drain at serving time and place them back on the stove for 20 or 30 seconds, so the heat will absorb whatever moisture remains.Prepare the corn12. Cut the kernels off the cob; a good ear of corn will yield about 1 cup of kernels. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet, add the corn kernels and salt and pepper, and cook over high heat, partially covered, for 3 to 4 minutes, until a crust begins to form in the bottom of the pan from the release of sugar from the corn mixing with the oil. This gives it a wonderful aroma and that delightful taste of roasted corn.13. Spoon the corn into the center of six hot dinner plates, place the lobster meat on top, and spoon on some of the sauce. Arrange the potatoes around the corn. Serve the bisque in small cups next to the lobster as an accompaniment.',
